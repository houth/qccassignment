   <p> "I was not so much observing the play as observing the players. They were the monarchs, and the managers and reporters were their subjects. To report on Go as if it were a pursuit of supreme dignity and importance - and I could not pretend to understand it perfectly 
    - I had to respect and admire the players. I was presently able to feel not only interest in the match but a sense of Go as an art, and that was because I reduced myself to nothing as I gazed at the Master."
    Yasunari Kawabata in The Master of Go

    “Happiness is something you lay siege to, it is a battle like a game of go. I will take hold of all the pain and snuff it out.”
    ― Shan Sa, The Girl Who Played Go <br>
